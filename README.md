# Svelte is the Future

This repository contains a SvelteKit presentation aimed at demonstrating the advantages and core concepts of Svelte compared to other major frameworks like React and Angular.
This was presented to the HMCTS Engineering Community in May 2024. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. This project was built using Node.js version 16.x or newer.
If you want to use the features within the OpenAI slide (i.e. `/await`), you'll need an OpenAI API key, saved in a .env within the root directory of the project with the name `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
